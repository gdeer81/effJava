    public static void main(String[] args) {

        //Cloneable determines the behavior of Object's protected clone method which returns a field-by-field copy
        //of the object, otherwise throw CloneNotSupportedException. Also, it does not have a 'clone' method of its own.

        //The class and superclasses must obey a fairly complex, unenforceable, and thinly documented protocol.
        //--SEE cloneMethod below--

        //In practice, programmers assume that if they extend a class and invoke super.clone from the subclass, the
        //returned object will be an instance of the subclass. The ONLY way superclass can provide this functionality
        //is to return an object obtained by calling super.clone. If a clone method returns an object created by a
        //constructor, it will have the wrong class. THEREFORE, if you override the clone method in a non-final class,
        //you should return an object obtained by invoking super.clone. If they all obey this rule then super.clone
        //will eventually invoke Object's clone method, creating an instance of the right class.

        //-As of 1.5, the clone method returns the actual class and not just Object. Because Object.clone returns
        // Object, PhoneNumber.clone must cast the result of super.clone()
        // before returning it which is preferable than requiring every caller of PhoneNumber.clone cast the result.
        //***GENERAL PRINCIPLE at play here is never make the client do anything the library can do for the client.***

        //-The problem with the clone architecture is that its incompatible with normal use of final fields referring
        //to mutable objects, except in cases where the mutable objects may be safely shared between an object and
        //its clone. In order to make it cloneable, may be necessary to remove final modifiers from some fields.

        //-A final approach to cloning complex objects is to call super.clone, set all of the fields in the result to
        //the original state, then call higher-level methods to regenerate the state of the object.

        //-One more detail: If you decide to make a thread-safe class implement Cloneable, remember that its clone
        //method must be properly synchronized just like any other method. Object's clone method is not synchronized,
        //so even if it is otherwise satisfactory, you may have to write a synchronized clone method that invokes
        //super.clone().

        //-Overall, classes that implement Cloneable should override clone with a public method whose return type
        // is the class itself. This method should first call super.clone and then fix any fields that need to be
        // fixed. Typically, this means copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure" of the
        // object being cloned, and replacing the clone's references to these objects with references to the copies.
        // While these internal copies can generally be made by calling clone recursively, this is not always the best
        // approach. If the class contains only primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is
        // probably the case that no fields need to be fixed. There are exceptions to this rule. For example, a field
        // representing a serial number or other unique ID or a field representing the object's creation time will
        // need to be fixed, even if it is primitive or immutable.

        //-A fine approach to object copying is to provide a copy constructor to copy factory. A copy constructor is
        // simply a constructor that takes a single argument whose type is the class containing the constructor.

        //- Copy constructor can be better than implementing Cloneable. they don't rely on risk-prone extralinguistic
        // object creation mechanism; they don't demand unenforceable adherence to thinly documented conventions; they
        // don't conflict with the proper use of final fields; they don't throw unnecessary checked exceptions; and they
        // don't require casts. It is impossible to put a copy constructor or factory in an interface, Cloneable also
        // fails to function as an interface because it lacks a public clone method. Therefore, you aren't giving up
        // interface functionality by using a copy constructor in preference to a clone method.
        // Furthermore, a copy constructor can take an argument whose type is an interface implemented by the class,
        // which means you can choose the implementation type of the copy rather than forcing the client to accept the
        // type of the original by using a clone method.

        //-TL;DR - Given the problems with Cloneable, its safe to say that other interfaces should not extend it, and
        // that classes designed for inheritance should not implement it either. If you decide to design a class for
        // inheritance, be aware that if you choose not to provide a well-behaved protected clone method, it will be
        // impossible for subclasses to implement Cloneable.
