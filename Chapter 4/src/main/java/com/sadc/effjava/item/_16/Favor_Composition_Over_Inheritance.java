public class Favor_Composition_Over_Inheritance {

	//Unlike method invocation, inheritance violates encapsulation. This is because in inheritance, the subclass
	//depends on the implementation details of the super. If the super's implementation is changed, then the subclass
	//may not function properly. The book gives an example of extending HashSet and assuming to know what addAll does
	//without knowing about its implementation.

	//Rather than extend an existing class, create a private field in your subclass that references an instance of the
	//super class. This is "composition". Create methods in your subclass that call the methods of the superclass.
	//This is "forwarding".

	//TODO: Implement wrapper class

	//Creating a wrapper class like this is known as the "decorator" pattern. The combination of composition and
	//forwarding is called "delegation".

	//Use the "is-a" test to determine whether you should implement the decorator pattern or use inheritance. If every
	//B is not truly an A, then don't extend.
