    // with an array you find out that youâ€™ve made a mistake at runtime; with a list, you find out at compile time.
    // 2) Arrays are reified, arrays know and enforce their element types at runtime.
    // For example, it is illegal to create an array of a generic type, a parameterized type, or a type parameter.
    // Can't create generic arrays, it isn't typesafe
    //Types such as E, List<E>, and List<String> are technically known as non-reifiable types .
    // Intuitively speaking, a non-reifiable type is one whose runtime representation contains less information than
    // its compile-time representation.
